# Best practices for using {{site.data.keyword.spectrum_full_notm}} through an LDAP user
{: #submit-jobs-lsf-ldap}

After you have integrated OpenLDAP with your {{site.data.keyword.spectrum_short}} cluster, refer to the following guidance for best practices when running LSF commands and submitting LSF jobs as an LDAP user.

All of the following commands can also be run from the login node.
{: note}

1. Log into the management node using the `ssh_to_management_node` value as shown as part of output section of {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} job log:

    * Primary management node:

    ```text
    ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -J vpcuser@<floating_IP_address> lsfadmin@<management_node_IP_address>
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    where `<floating_IP_address>` is the floating IP address for the bastion node and `<management_node_IP_address>` is the IP address for the management node.

    * Login node:

    ```text
    ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -J vpcuser@<floating_IP_address> lsfadmin@<login_node_IP_address>
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    where `<floating_IP_address>` is the floating IP address for the bastion node and `<login_node_IP_address>` is the IP address for the login node.

2. Switch to the LDAP user (for example, switch to **lsfuser05**):

    ```text
    $ [lsfadmin@lsfuser05-ubuntu-two-mgmt-1 ~]$ su lsfuser05
    Password:
    $ [lsfuser05@lsfuser05-ubuntu-two-mgmt-1 lsfadmin]#
    ```
    {: codeblock}

3. Run LSF commands as the the LDAP user:

    ```text
    $ [lsfuser05@lsfuser05-ubuntu-two-mgmt-1 lsfadmin]$ lshosts -w
    HOST_NAME                        type   model    cpuf ncpus maxmem maxswp server RESOURCES
    lsfuser05-ubuntu-two-mgmt-1 X86_64 Intel_E5 12.5 2     7.5G   -      Yes    (mg)
    lsfuser05-ubuntu-two-mgmt-2 X86_64 Intel_E5 12.5 2     7.5G   -      Yes    (mg)
    lsfuser05-ubuntu-two-mgmt-3 X86_64 Intel_E5 12.5 2     7.5G   -      Yes    (mg)

    $ [lsfuser05@lsfuser05-ubuntu-two-mgmt-1 lsfadmin]$ bhosts -w
    HOST_NAME                        STATUS      JL/U MAX NJOBS RUN SSUSP USUSP RSV

    lsfuser05-ubuntu-two-mgmt-2 closed_Full -    0   0     0   0     0     0
    lsfuser05-ubuntu-two-mgmt-3 closed_Full -    0   0     0   0     0     0

    $ [lsfuser05@lsfuser05-ubuntu-two-mgmt-1 lsfadmin]$ lsload
    HOST_NAME            status r15s r1m r15m ut pg  ls it tmp swp mem

    $ [lsfuser05@lsfuser05-ubuntu-two-mgmt-1 lsfadmin]$ bjobs
    No unfinished job found

4.  Submit an LSF job as the LDAP user:

    ```text
    [lsfuser05@lsfuser05-ubuntu-two-mgmt-1 lsfadmin]$ bsub -J myjob[1-4] -R "rusage[mem=2G]" sleep 10
    Job <2> is submitted to default queue <normal>.
    ```
