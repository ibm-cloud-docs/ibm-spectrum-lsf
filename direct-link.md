# Installing Direct Link to an HPC cluster
{: #installing-direct-link-cluster}

{{site.data.keyword.spectrum_full}} multi-cluster capability allows you to share resources between clusters through resource leasing or job forwarding. Multiple LSF clusters can also solve problems related to ease of administration, scalability, and sites in different geographic locations. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} hybrid cloud HPC solution uses these core functions of {{site.data.keyword.spectrum_short}} to create a seamless integration of {{site.data.keyword.spectrum_full_notm}} cluster in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and on-premises. Job forwarding configurations can be used as an easy way to transparently schedule the workload execution on the {{site.data.keyword.spectrum_full_notm}} cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, while having the full administration and control possible from the {{site.data.keyword.spectrum_full_notm}} cluster on-premises.

You can use {{site.data.keyword.dl_full_notm}} for your hybrid connection between on-premises and your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account. For more information on how to get started and order {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.dl_full_notm}} (2.0)](/docs/dl?topic=dl-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-dl).

After you configure and validate the connectivity from on-premises to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, you are ready to [Set up the multi-cluster and job forwarding using {{site.data.keyword.spectrum_short}}](/docs/ibm-spectrum-lsf?topic=ibm-spectrum-lsf-set-up-multi-cluster-job-forwarding).
