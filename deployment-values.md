# Deployment values
{: #deployment-values}

The following deployment values can be used to configure the {{site.data.keyword.spectrum_short}} cluster instance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}:

NOT_SET refers to an empty value in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog tile. If you are using other modes like CLI, API, or Schematics UI directly to provision the HPC cluster, leave the values empty.
{: note}

For more information on how to create an API key, see [Managing user API keys](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey). | Yes | None |
| `app_center_db_pwd` | Password for MariaDB. Note: Password must be at least eight characters, must have one number, one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and at least one special character. | No | None |
| `app_center_gui_pwd` | Password for LSF Application Center GUI. Note: Password should be at least eight characters, must have one number, one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and at least one special character. | No | None |
| `cluster_prefix` | Prefix that is used to name the {{site.data.keyword.spectrum_full_notm}} cluster and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that are provisioned to build the {{site.data.keyword.spectrum_full_notm}} cluster instance.
