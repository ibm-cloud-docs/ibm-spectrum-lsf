# Adding compute profile types for auto scaling
{: #add-compute-profile-types}

Complete the following steps to add compute profile types when worker nodes are automatically added by the resource connector.

If you need to add multiple profiles, step 1 is sufficient and the restart `mbatchd` command is enough. The remaining steps are for submitting a job to a specific by tagging the virtual machine with templateID as a string resource.
{: note}

1. Add a new template section to the templates list. Review the values for all the properties to ensure that they map to the correct VPC configuration. Update the file `ibmcloudgen2_templates.json` in `$LSF_ENDIR/resource_connector/ibmcloudgen2/conf`. A typical HPC cluster that is installed on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} have this file in `/opt/ibm/lsf/conf/resource_connector/ibmcloudgen2/conf`. See the following sample content for an example:

    ```
    {
    "templates": [
    {
    "templateId": "<TemplateID>",
    "maxNumber": 200,
    "attributes": {
    "type": ["String", "X86_64"],
    "ncores": ["Numeric", "1"],
    "ncpus": ["Numeric", "1"],
    "mem": ["Numeric", "1024"],
    "icgen2host": ["Boolean", "1"],
    "templateID": ["String", "<TemplateID>"]
    },
    "imageId": "<IMAGE_ID>",
    "subnetId": "<SUBNET_ID>",
    "vpcId": "<SUBNET_ID>",
    "vmType": "cx2-2x4",
    "securityGroupIds": ["<SECURITY_GROUP_ID>"],
    "sshkey_id": "<SSH_KEY_ID>",
    "region": "us-south",
    "zone": "us-south-1",
    "userData": "<TemplateID>"
    }
    ]
    }
    ```
    {: screen}

    Use a valid value for template ID. A '-' (hyphen) cannot be used in templateId when using it as a string resource or else you might get this error:

    Error in select section: Operator "-" cannot be used with type to get type. Job not submitted.
    {: note}

2. When the template is added, you can use the `lsf.shared` file to map the new template to a specific job. The `lsf.shared` file is located in `$LSF_ENVDIR` (same location as `lsf.conf`). In a typical installation, this would be found in the `/opt/ibm/lsf/conf` folder. Add _templateId_ as a resource in the resource section in the `lsf.shared` file. For example, templateID String () () (template ID for the external hosts).

3. Add the following section to `user_data.sh` to the virtual machines add _templateId_ as `LSF_LOCAL_RESOURCES`.

    ```
    if [ -n "$template_id" ]; then
    sed -i "s/\(LSF_LOCAL_RESOURCES=.*\)\"/\1 [resourcemap $template_id*templateID]\"/" $LSF_CONF_FILE
    echo "update LSF_LOCAL_RESOURCES in $LSF_CONF_FILE successfully, add [resourcemap ${template_id}*templateID]" >> $logfile
    else
    echo "templateID doesn't exist in environment variable" >> $logfile
    fi
    ```
    {: screen}

    The `user_data.sh` is specified by the `IBMCLOUDGEN2_PROVISION_FILE` variable in the `ibmcloudgen2_config.json` file. `ibmcloudgen2_config.json` is located in `/opt/ibm/lsf/conf/resource_connector/ibmcloudgen2/conf`. See the following sample file content for an example:

    ```
    "IBMCLOUDGEN2_KEY_FILE": "/opt/ibm/lsf/conf/resource_connector/ibmcloudgen2/credentials",
    "IBMCLOUDGEN2_PROVISION_FILE": "/opt/ibm/lsf/conf/resource_connector/ibmcloudgen2/user_data.sh",
    "IBMCLOUDGEN2_MACHINE_PREFIX": "icgen2host",
    "LogLevel": "INFO"
    ```
    {: screen}

4. Run the following commands to restart the process and apply the changes:
     ```
     $lsadmin reconfig
     $badmin mbdrestart
      ```

5. You can submit the change by using the `-R` option. In the following, "Template2" is an example value for Template ID:

    ```
    bsub -R “templateId=Template2” sleep 1000
    ```
